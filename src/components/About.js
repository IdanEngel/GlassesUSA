            7 out of 10 adults in the U.S need eye correction. When we founded
            our company 10 years ago, it was very clear to see that people were
            overpaying for glasses as they were perceived mainly as a health
            necessity and the stores were taking advantage of that. Back then
            the variety was limited and the prices were so high that purchasing
            eyewear was considered a burden. This is still true in many cases
            and we are here to change that, to make a difference.
